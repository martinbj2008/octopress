When we compile a glibc(or eglibc), we need generated the timezone data file with it. although, it is stable and no change almost in every version update.

Today a problem is met about it.

We use the old glibcâ€™s timezone file, which is used by many different toolchain for several paltforms. 

unfortunately.the data file has been change after 2007 year by GNU official. but I did not found the exact version(date) of glibc, which change the timezone data file.

btw: toolchain = binutils + gcc + glibc(eglic) + kernel(header)
